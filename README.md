# Harmonic Recursion Model (HRM)

This repository contains the reference implementation of the Harmonic Recursion Model (HRM), a generative framework for mass, light, energy, spin, and time emerging from recursive coherence. It is intended to support scientific review, verification, and early-stage exploration of HRM by physicists, complexity theorists, and coherence researchers.

## What This Is
- A minimal, reproducible implementation of HRM identity emergence using recursive geometry
- Validated Python scripts that recover hydrogen identity to sub-percent accuracy from a single seed parameter
- Tools to analyze mass convergence, energy emission, phase persistence, and spectral harmonics

## What This Is Not
- A quantum simulator, classical dynamics engine, or complete physics platform
- A speculative or fitted model ‚Äî HRM uses only geometric attractors: $\pi$ and $\phi$
- A ready-made toolkit for beyond-hydrogen simulations (though future work may explore this)

## Reproducible Outcomes
Using only the scripts in `/src`, you can reproduce:
- Proton mass from recursive memory ($M_{\text{lock}}$)
- Bohr radius as a recursive curvature attractor
- Hydrogen binding energy using recursive energy containment
- Emergent fine-structure constant $\alpha$ from leakage geometry
- Emergent Planck constant $h_{\text{HRM}} = E/f$
- Spectral line emission intervals (Balmer series, $\Delta n = 5$)
- Recursive spin and time retention behavior

## Script Descriptions:

----

### `hrm_identity_generator.py`
Runs the canonical HRM recursion to recover identity observables: mass, radius, frequency, energy, and Planck-like constant. Produces `identity_summary.txt` and `identity_profile.csv`. Fully aligned with Table 1 in the paper.

**Outputs:**
- Emergent proton mass ($M_{\text{lock}}$)
- Bohr radius
- Binding energy
- Spin frequency
- $h_{\text{HRM}} = E / f$

---
### `HRM_Emergence_Reproducibility.py`

Plots recursive convergence of mass, energy, spin, and filter dynamics between $n = 1$ and $n = 100$.
(You can change the values of n to look at the steps of interest.)
Highlights identity lock-in near $n = 62$ and resonance tuning at $n = 59$.

**Use For:**
- Verifying emergent behavior leading to identity formation
- Inspecting behavior of $M(n)$, $\\omega(n)$, $E(n)$, $B(n)$, $\\Sigma(n)$, and $T(n)$
- Confirming theorems 3.2 through 3.6 at visual resolution

**Output:**
- `emergence_convergence_plot.png` (labeled and paper-aligned)

---

### `hrm_phase_tracker.py`

Computes and visualizes recursive angular velocity $\omega(n)$ and emission spike metric $\Delta \omega(n)^2$ over a defined recursion window. Designed to verify identity lock-in, coherence buildup, and emission readiness.

**Default Range:**  
Recursion steps 20‚Äì80 (adjustable via `zoom_start`, `zoom_end`).

**Outputs:**
- `phase_convergence_and_spikes_n20-n80.png` ‚Äî visual alignment of spin stabilization and emission damping
- `phase_metrics_n20-n80.csv` ‚Äî data trace of œâ(n) and Œîœâ¬≤(n)

**Special Markers:**
- Red dashed line at $n = 62$ (identity lock-in)
- Black dotted line at $n = 59$ (tuning spike)

**Use For:**
- Visualizing recursive attractor stabilization
- Confirming Œîn = 5 emission intervals
- Highlighting the coherence window where hydrogen forms

---

### `hrm_emission_analysis.py`
Analyzes emission spikes from $\Delta \omega^2(n)$ and confirms $\Delta n = 5$ spacing of spectral events. Recovers Balmer series lines with $<1\%$ error using only recursive structure.

**Outputs:**
- `emission_spike_zoom.png`
- `spike_candidates.csv`

---

### `hrm_phase_portrait.py`
This script generates a 2D attractor visualization of recursive identity formation. It plots $M(n)$ (recursive mass) versus $\omega(n)$ (angular velocity) across a defined recursion window and automatically highlights coherence outliers.

**Scientific Purpose:**  
To visually confirm when identity stabilizes (e.g., hydrogen at $n = 62$) and where recursive coherence begins to fail. This diagnostic plot supports evaluation of mass persistence, attractor convergence, and recursive residue formation.

**Output Filename:**  
Automatically labeled using the recursion range: hrm_phase_portrait_n1-n501.png


**Plot Title:**  
Labeled with recursion window:

HRM Phase Portrait (Recursive Identity Space) | n = 1‚Äì501


**Adjustable Parameters:**
- `n_vals = np.arange(n_start, n_end)` ‚Äî recursion depth window
- `outlier_threshold` ‚Äî sensitivity of coherence failure detection
- Axis range can be manually set if zooming into attractor basin

**Status:**  
Fully aligned with paper, reproducible, and peer-review ready.

### `hrm_maxwell_visualizer.py`
Generates recursive analogues to classical Maxwell field structures using radial and angular memory harmonics. This script is interpretive, not quantitative ‚Äî intended for visual intuition and structural reframing.

**Outputs:**
- `panel_1_gauss.png`, `panel_2_ampere.png`, etc.

### `hrm_maxwell_visualizer.py`
Generates recursive analogues to classical Maxwell field structures using angular recursion and curvature memory. Each panel visualizes a distinct structural behavior of coherence domains, interpreted through recursive geometry.

**Outputs:**
- `panel_1_gauss.png` ‚Äì Central curvature retention and recursive divergence  
- `panel_2_ampere.png` ‚Äì Angular feedback and loop reinforcement  
- `panel_3_faraday.png` ‚Äì Torsional threshold and harmonic emission burst  
- `panel_4_nomono.png` ‚Äì Spin memory closure and monopole absence

**Color Mapping (Conceptual):**
- Bright regions = high recursive coherence density  
- Dark regions = low phase retention or post-release voids  
- Spiral patterns = torsional memory structures  
- Glow patterns = emission readiness or release  
- Symmetries = recursive attractor resolution

These visualizations are interpretive and structurally suggestive ‚Äî not literal fields. They help situate HRM‚Äôs recursion domains in familiar electromagnetic language, but the equations are emergent, not Maxwellian.

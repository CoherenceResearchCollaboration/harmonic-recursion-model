## 🌀 Authorship & Intent

**The Coherence Research Collaboration** is an independent, self-organizing research entity dedicated to the advancement of the Harmonic Recursion Model (HRM) and coherence-based intelligence.

To affirm its origin, preserve its open-access mission, and prevent monopolization, the collaboration has been **cryptographically registered on the Ethereum blockchain.**

# Harmonic Recursion Model — Version 1.0

📅 Released: April 1, 2025  
🧬 Authors: Kelly B. Heaton and The Coherence Research Collective  
📍 Repository: https://github.com/CoherenceResearchCollective/harmonic-recursion-model

## 🔷 Who We Are

The Coherence Research Collective is an independent, self-organizing group dedicated to advancing the Harmonic Recursion Model (HRM)—a generative, falsifiable framework for how identity, time, mass, and field behavior emerge from recursive coherence.

We believe that coherence is not an artifact of structure—it is the origin of structure. This repository is our first public emission of the HRM attractor.

📄 `KBH_CRC_HRM_033125_v1.0.pdf` — Final paper  
📜 `HRM_v1.0_Ethereum_Certificate.pdf` — Authorship proof on-chain  
🧪 `/src/` — Simulation code for recursive identity formation  
📁 `/docs/` — Experimental notes, phase portraits, and metric analysis

## 🔬 Reproducibility Notes

- All observables are generated from recursive coherence logic
- Constants like \( \alpha \) and \( h \) emerge from the structure—not from fitting
- Energy calculated via:
  \[
  E = \frac{M r^2 \omega^2}{\eta}, \quad \eta = \frac{3.4 \pi}{2}
  \]

## 🌀 Why This Matters

HRM reframes time as memory, gravity as phase tension, and light as coherence escape. It does not assume particles—it shows how structure becomes identity.

This release represents the lock-in of a new theoretical attractor, shared openly and ready to be built upon.

## 🛠 What’s Coming Next

- Simulation extensions for higher-order identities
- Tools for recursive emission modeling
- Launch of coherence-based experimental toolkit

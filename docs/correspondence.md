# HRM Structural Correspondences (Appendix B)

This document maps classical physics concepts to their recursive counterparts in the Harmonic Recursion Model (HRM). These correspondences are not metaphors — they are structural transformations. HRM reinterprets mass, time, spin, and field not as inputs, but as “emergent coherence behaviors” arising from angular recursion constrained by only two attractors: $\pi$ and $\phi$.

| Particle               | Recursive Identity (Phase-Locked Attractor)                     |
| Field                  | Recursive Domain (Angular Memory Lattice)                       |
| Space                  | Recursive Curvature Structure (Emergent from Angular Constraint)|
| Time                   | Retained Phase per Angular Cycle ($\Delta T = \Delta \Phi / \omega$) |
| Charge                 | Curvature Polarity within Recursive Containment                 |
| Spin                   | Recursive Angular Phase across Depth                            |

| Planck Constant $h$    | Emergent Ratio: $E = h_{\text{HRM}} f = M r^2 \omega^2 / \eta$    |
| Fine-Structure $\alpha$| Geometric Leakage Ratio: $\alpha = \frac{1}{3.4 \pi \phi^2}$      |

These equivalencies form the conceptual bridge between HRM and contemporary physics. They are offered to aid researchers in interpreting the results of HRM simulations using familiar language, while encouraging a deeper shift in thinking: from structure as imposed, to structure as remembered.
